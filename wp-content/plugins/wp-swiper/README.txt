!!! IMPORTANT !!!

I use this plugin internally to build awesome sliders. At the moment only essential Swiper options are available. More to come!!!

If you urgently need a feature, please reach out to me.
If you are a designer and have an interface design in mind, let me know.

The backend UI is not the prettiest thing at the moment. But it's very intuitive and does the job! The interface is set up as a series of tabs, each tab controls a slide. Click on the tab and you may upload an image. Click on the WP Swiper block and you can control slider overlay + color overlay.

Another note re: backend UI, the original idea was generate the functional slider within the editor. But theres an issue with conteneditable HTML elements. I lodged [an issue](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/3801) on official swiper github repo for them to resolve. Leave a comment for them to prioritise the solution.

If you want to use the slide with text. 
Select slide, add image, the image gonna appear as a background on the frontend.
If you want to use the slider for images, just add a regular image block.

Features:
<ul>
<li>Add image overlay for the whole slider + control opacity</li>
<li>Add color overlay for the whole slider + control opacity</li>
<li>Add image to the slider</li>
<li>Add content (text, headings, anything...) to the slider</li>
<li>Position content for each slider</li>
</ul>

More Features to be added:
<ul>
<li>Control height of the slider</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Other features from the official swiper docs</li>
</ul>
